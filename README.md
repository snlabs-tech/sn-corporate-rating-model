# SN_Corporate-Rating-Model
This tool implements a simple, transparent corporate credit scoring model that maps a 0–100 score to an alphabetic grade (AAA–CCC ). It is designed for educational &amp; exploratory use, not for regulatory capital ratings. The model combines quantitative block based on financial ratios and qualitative block based on 1–5 expert assessments.
